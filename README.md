[00:06.08] Don't wanna live as an untold story
[00:09.25] Rather go out in a blaze of glory
[00:12.19] I can't hear you, I don't fear you
[00:29.19] 
[00:18.22] I live now 'cause the bad die last
[00:21.38] Dodging bullets with your broken past
[00:23.83] Well, I can't hear you, I don't fear you now
[00:45.83] 
[00:31.38] Wrapped in your regret
[00:34.05] What a waste of blood and sweat, oh-oh-oh
[00:54.55] 
[00:39.53] I wanna taste love and pain
[00:42.67] Wanna feel pride and shame
[00:45.67] Don't wanna take my time
[00:48.75] Don't wanna waste one line
[00:51.56] I wanna live better days
[00:54.66] Never look back and say
[00:57.35] It could have been me
[01:00.66] It could have been me
[01:04.22] Yeah!
[01:06.72] 
[01:07.69] Don't wanna wake up on a Monday morning
[01:10.53] The thought of work's getting my skin crawling
[01:13.55] I can't fear you, I don't hear you now
[01:32.55] 
[01:20.94] Wrapped in your regret
[01:23.38] What a waste of blood and sweat, oh-oh-oh
[01:43.88] 
[01:29.13] I wanna taste love and pain (I wanna taste love)
[01:32.02] Wanna feel pride and shame
[01:35.24] Don't wanna take my time (no)
[01:38.30] Don't wanna waste one line (hey-hey-hey)
[01:41.08] I wanna live better days (better days)
[01:44.27] Never look back and say
[01:47.12] It could have been me (it could have been me)
[01:50.13] It could have been me (it could have been me)
[02:12.63] 
[01:53.02] I wanna taste love and pain (I wanna taste love and pain)
[01:56.02] I wanna feel pride and shame (I wanna feel pride and shame)
[01:59.10] I don't wanna take my time
[02:02.32] I don't wanna waste one line (I don't wanna waste my time, don't wanna waste one line)
[02:05.13] I wanna live better days
[02:08.18] Never look back and say
[02:11.05] It could have been me
[02:13.62] Oh, it could have been me
[02:16.92] It could have been me
