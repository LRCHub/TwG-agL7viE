I could have been a gardener digging up the weeds
I could have been a farmer sowing seeds
I could have been a painter with a whole new point of view
I could have been standing next to someone like you
It could have been me

I could have been a sailor testing the breeze
I could have been a failure hiding in the trees
I could have been a vagabond with nothing left to lose
I could have been making love to someone like you
It could have been me

I could have been reaching out with an olive leaf in my hand
I could have been screaming out like the leader of the band
I could have been anything if I could only choose
I'd want to be waking up with someone like you
It could have been me
