Another day, the sunlight on the floor
Still it's not the same as it was before
The silence of you gone just drives me crazy
The screaming in my head even more
I know that I was meant to love you
But there's so much more to love
So here's a small reminder
That you can always think of
It could've been me, taking you to the movies
It could've been me, holding your hand
It could've been me, walking out on Sundays
It could've been you and me
So many times you've tried to walk away
Looking for the man to go your way

But when love comes around the corner
And you're ready to go
Just keep that small reminder
that I'd still like you to know
It could've been me, taking you to the movies
It could've been me, holding your hand
It could've been me, walking out on Sundays
It could've been you and me
Oh baby can't you see that I'm down on my knees
Begging you
So if you ever think about me
When the sunlight's on your floor
I know you will remember
The way it was before
